Usage: sudo ./tools/passthrough.sh status  [<pci-address>...]
       sudo ./tools/passthrough.sh prepare <pci-address> [<pci-address>...]
       sudo ./tools/passthrough.sh restore <pci-address> [<pci-address>...]

install.sh already sets passthrough up. Cards are armed at every boot and the GSP
boot registers are restored automatically whenever anything binds a card to vfio-pci,
so assigning a GPU to a VM in Proxmox or libvirt needs no command here at all.

This tool is for the cases that are not automatic:

  status   what state each card is in, including whether its GSP registers are clean
  prepare  bind a card to vfio-pci right now, by hand, instead of letting the
           hypervisor do it at VM start
  restore  give a card back to the host driver. Needed after a VM was killed rather
           than shut down: that leaves the ACR version stamp set, the stamp is write
           protected once set, and the next VM would get no GPU. restore clears it and
           re-arms the card.

Addresses are full PCI addresses, e.g. 0000:04:00.0.
